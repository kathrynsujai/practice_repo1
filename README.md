# practice_repo1
This is my first repository I made in Stat 184 to explore Github. 
There is no data as of right now because this is just a practice repository.
The current plan is to explore the functions of Git and how to create and collaborate on Git.
This repo wukk yse a simple orangizational structure. All files will be found in the top level and without any sub-folders.
